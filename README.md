# ERC-721: Token Standard

[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing non-fungible tokens. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 721 is the number that was assigned to this request. The clear purpose of the ERC-721 standard is to ensure that all non-fungible tokens released on the Ethereum blockchain will be compatible with the wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts that also use the same standard.

This repository is part of the `Advanced Foundry` course given by Cyfrin Updraft [here](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/advanced-foundry/).

The implementation of the ERC-721 standard is done in the `src` directory and is using [ERC-721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc721) contract from OpenZeppelin. The `test` directory contains the tests for the ERC-721 implementation.
